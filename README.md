# Azure VM Deployment with Terraform

This repository contains Terraform scripts to deploy an Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine (VM) in Azure within an existing network and subnet. The VM is accessible via SSH using a generated SSH key pair. The setup follows best practices for infrastructure as code (IaC) and uses Azure's France Central region.

## Features

- **Azure Virtual Machine**: Deploys a Ubuntu 22.04 VM using the Standard_D2s_v3 size.
- **SSH Access**: Generates an SSH key pair and configures the VM to allow SSH access.
- **Public IP**: Assigns a static public IP address to the VM for remote access.
- **Existing Network**: Utilizes an existing virtual network and subnet for VM deployment.
- **Security**: Disables password authentication to ensure access is secured via SSH keys only.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- Azure CLI installed
- Terraform v0.12.x or later
- An Azure subscription
- Access to an existing resource group, virtual network, and subnet
